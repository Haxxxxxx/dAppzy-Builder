White Paper

### 1. **Title Page**

- **Title:** Third Space Builder
- **Subtitle:** Build Web 3 Projects Effortlessly with No-Code Tools
- **Author(s):** Lead by Pauline Mila-Alonso and Vincent Charles, written by Antoine Vignat
- **Date:** The date of publication.

### 2. **Abstract**

- A concise summary of the whitepaper, including the problem, solution, and key benefits of your project. This should be engaging and provide a high-level overview.

### 3. **Introduction**

- **Problem Statement:** The web3 market suffers from an elitism that hinders its expansion and sharing with newcomers. New creators and curious entrepreneurs quickly find themselves up against an impenetrable technological wall.  It is difficult to break into a fast-moving sector without knowing what it is all about, which makes it both innovative and niche. We want to break down this barrier by making web3 much more accessible, firstly through a technological tool that is easy to learn, but above all by abolishing the need for hard coding in the sector.
- **Solution Overview:** Third Space Builder is an innovative technical solution on the web3. It's the first builder to support its users from A to Z without them having to write code. Unlike many of our competitors, we offer a completely no-code, easy-to-use service. Thanks to this, we are enabling native web3 users to design their projects on blockchain more quickly. We are also freeing non-native users from the technological language barrier, which is quite complex to decipher.

### 4. **Market Analysis**

- **Industry Background:** Web3 has always been an El Dorado for developers and financiers since its democratisation in 2014 and even before. It is a technological niche with many interesting and avant-garde projects in the medical, artistic, financial and economic fields. Never before has anything been done to help newcomers to this world. It is only recently that large entities have begun to move the frontiers of web3 to make it more accessible, notably with the development of several CMS or builders, but also the Solana Blinks technology.
- **Market Needs:** The market demands fluidity, speed and interoperability. It is imperative for users to be able to communicate with each other and share their work more easily than is currently the case. The 2 largest blockchains are not developed in the same language, so it is almost impossible for them to communicate with each other without going through a large number of technical intermediaries. It is a sector that is evolving very quickly and looks increasingly promising. The world's leading tech companies have been working in this field for many years, without ever revealing their secret projects. So the market needs to become better known and more accessible.
- **Competitive Analysis:** With Third Space, we set out to meet 7 key requirements for a web3 ecosystem builder:
- A developer mode
- Free to use
- Base the project on the blockchain of the user's choice
- User-friendly
- Combine speed and fluidity
- Giving users freedom
- Available on all media

We have drawn up a non-exhaustive list of competitors who are close to us or whose potential is close to that of our product: Bildr / Directual / Webstudio / Bonfire / ICME. 

Most of our competitors are more advanced than we are when it comes to the product, but they are lagging far behind when it comes to their vision of the market and the product as a whole. The reason is simple: they are bigger than Third Space. However, they don't innovate compared to a web2 builder or a web2 CMS. We are one of the few companies to offer cross-chain content and, above all, comprehensive support for non-native web3 users. This allows us to be ahead of the game and far more relevant than our competitors. 

### 5. **Project Details**

- **Project Vision:** Third Space's long-term vision is to promote creativity and entrepreneurship on the web3 on a global scale. We want to support the user in their project from start to finish by giving them access to all the tools they need. Firstly, to enable it to create any type of project on the blockchain, any type of smart contract, any type of dApps, DeFi, etc. The user should not feel constrained or restricted in their use of the builder and, on the contrary, should feel free to create whatever they want with just one click. Secondly, we are keen to provide support. Offering learning platforms for beginners and the uninitiated. A series of lessons on the ecosystem they are entering, so that they can understand its essence as simply as possible. Anything that can make web3 more accessible is part of the Third Space project.
- **Mission Statement:** The mission of Third Space is to make as many blockchain ecosystems as possible accessible by allowing users to create their projects with an easy-to-use builder that connects directly with multiple trusted blockchains. The goal of the company is to enable users to create a wide range of projects from various backgrounds using our platform.

### 6. **Technical Overview**

- **Architecture:** Describe the overall architecture of your software.
- **Technology Stack:** Detail the technologies and platforms used.
- **Smart Contracts:** Explain the role and functionality of smart contracts within your project.
- **Security Measures:** Outline the security protocols and measures implemented to ensure safety.

### 7. **Tokenomics**

- **Token Model:** Explain the type of token, its utility, and how it integrates into the ecosystem.
- **Distribution Plan:** Provide details on the token distribution plan, including allocation for team, development, marketing, and reserves.
- **Incentives:** Describe any staking, rewards, or incentive mechanisms for token holders.

### 8. **Use Cases**

- Provide concrete examples of how your software can be used in real-world scenarios.

Person X is interested in developing a project on the web3, but doesn't know how to go about it because the environment seems too complex to integrate and he doesn't see the point. We exist to break down this barrier of entry between web2 and web3 users. Thanks to us, X will be able to set up a complete project and link it directly to the blockchain to benefit from all that it provides: transparency, consensus, cryptographic security and fluidity of assets. 

X can take on several identities. Firstly, the non-native web3 user who needs or wants to join the blockchain ecosystem. We act as a gateway by supporting them in their creation, but also by helping them to understand this new universe. 

X can also be an entrepreneur who is already active on the web3 and has several creations to his credit. His problem now is to be able to create more and more, but without getting in over his head. He has mastered the technology behind blockchain, but it is still expensive and laborious to use. Thanks to us, he can turn to a cheaper and more efficient solution.

With Third Space, you can create anything you like on the blockchain of your choice (among our partners). dApps, DeFi, e-commerce, landing page, portfolio, walletâ€¦

- Explain the benefits for different stakeholders (users, developers, businesses).

Users: Fast, easy access to a complex environment. We provide the easy way to create on the decentralised Internet. The user is helped from start to finish to learn and design in total simplicity. 

Developers: Facilitating the use of blockchain. A developer can always code from what they have created on Third Space to extend or customise their project even further. The idea is to see Third Space as a tool that takes some of the work out of the developer's hands. 

Businesses: Gain a foothold in web3 and reach a new target audience. Legitimise a place in the tech business. Secure your data and remain transparent with your customers at all times. Write the history of the Internet by inking the name of the business in block. 

### 9. **Roadmap**

- **Development Stages:** Outline the key milestones and timelines for development.
- **Future Plans:** At long-termes, we are keen to set up Third Space Academy, a series of learning modules on the habits and customs of web3. It's also an opportunity for users to be supported in creating their own projects.

We would like to develop our own internal AI at Third Space so that it can guide us and our users through the different versions. An internal version at Third Space, a multi-tool assistant for site management. An external version, a sophisticated chatbot and personalised consultant for creating projects on the platform. 

### 10. **Governance**

- **Governance Model:** Describe how decisions are made within your project (e.g., DAO, voting mechanisms).
- **Community Involvement:** Explain how the community can participate in governance.

### 11. **Team**

- **Team Members:** The Third Space team is made up of three members: two founders and a partner. Set up in 2023 by Pauline Mila-Alonso and Vincent Charles, the team was joined by Florian Privat in the summer of 2024.

Pauline Mila-Alonso is CEO of Third Space, embodying the company's spirit and values of inclusion in the web3 ecosystem. With a background in marketing and communications, she has had the chance to work on web development projects. Initially fascinated by HTML and web design, she set up her own business to help small groups with the graphic redesign or creation of their website. She has also helped on a number of highly graphic portfolio projects, giving her a legitimate edge in front-end work. She has always been very committed to creating things. Starting with major French events like the Gaming Telethon at her school.

As CEO, Pauline performs all the company's administrative roles, as well as communications and marketing. She is a quick learner who has developed into a Swiss Army knife. She is also behind all the art direction and HTML development for the Third Space website. She is the main creator of the mock-ups used in the build software. 

Vincent Charles joined the project at its very beginning as CTO. He is the brains behind the site and the builder. With a background in computer engineering, and then the same training as Pauline, he had to learn all the rudiments of blockchain development on the job. He is also the partner with the most shares in the company after Pauline, which means that he is part of the company's management and has a say in Third Space's progress. 

In his role as CTO, he is responsible for the entire development of the site, which is no easy task for a single person. He works on all the backend aspects of Third Space, from the database to the builder functions and the smarts contracts code. 

Florian Privat joined the company during his work placement as a data analyst. Coming from the same background as his colleagues, he decided to change direction and take a more numerical approach. He has always been more interested in financial management and spreadsheets. That's why he is now CFO at Third Space and plays an important role in maintaining the company's financial stability. 

After being added to the company's capital, Florian also helped Pauline with administrative tasks to balance out the workload. On a day-to-day basis, he is responsible for compiling and analysing all the data circulating on the site and on the networks. He is treasurer and master of finance and acts as accountant. 

- **Advisors:** Houcine Atrous is one of those people who joined the project before it existed. Already operating on blockchains, owner of a digital stable and a number of NFTs, he had all the keys to understanding the web3 sector. As Pauline's companion, he inspired her to set up the Third Space project: to make it easier for people to access the Internet.

As a web3 advisor, Houcine is not with the team 100% of the time, but lends a hand by advising on strategic choices and training team members in web3 culture.

RÃ©mi Gaconier is the growth advisor who supports Third Space in its financial development and strategic market investments. He supports Pauline on a day-to-day basis in making important decisions, choosing the right timetable for raising funds, and providing the right contacts to reach people who could help the company grow. A specialist in business management, he has taken his experience in the world of start-ups and adapted it to web3 start-ups.

His role is to help Third Space stabilise economically and teach everything he can about the business world to a CEO who is learning every day how best to manage a start-up.

### 12. **Partnerships and Collaborations**

- Detail any existing partnerships and their significance.

We are working with Unstoppable Domain to host the domain names that will be created using our builder. They are giving us access to their domain names, which are among the most highly regarded in terms of security and plenipotential on blockchain. 

We are also working on the Stellar blockchain, which has trained and paid our developer so that we can contribute something to their chain. They are therefore direct partners in the project and allow us to publish projects on their blockchain. 

- Discuss potential future collaborations.

We are looking to collaborate with Solana, the blockchain that has hosted the project from the outset, in order to offer users a choice. 

### 13. **Legal and Regulatory Compliance**

- **Legal Structure:** Third Space is a SAS (Simplified Joint-Stock Company) with its headquarters in Saint-AndrÃ© de Corcy. We are represented by Camille Charles, an independent French lawyer specializing in intellectual property law.
- **Regulatory Considerations:** Discuss any regulatory compliance measures taken.
