You are a senior React documentation engineer. Using the section drafts provided below, generate a single, cohesive project documentation in Markdown. It must include:

1. **Project title and short introduction** (what the project is, its purpose and high-level architecture).
2. **Table of Contents** (auto-generated, linking to each feature section and file).
3. **H2 headings** for each top-level feature folder (components, context, utils, Elements, configs, services).
4. Under each H2, a one-paragraph summary of that folder’s role.
5. **H3 headings** for every file in that folder, each with:
   - A one-sentence overview of the file’s purpose.
   - A props/parameters table (with types and descriptions) or list of key functions/hooks.
   - A short Markdown usage example.
   - A bullet list of external dependencies.
6. **Consistent terminology and style** throughout (bullet lists, code blocks, etc.).
7. A final **“Getting Started”** section with setup and running instructions (e.g. `npm install`, `npm start`).
8. Any **caveats**, **notes on testing**, or **limitations** at the end.
